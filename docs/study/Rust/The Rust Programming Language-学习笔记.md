# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Installation

## 1.2 Hello, World!

指令：

+ `rustc main.rs` 编译main.rs文件，产生可执行二进制文件 main。（类似C语言gcc编译）
+ `rustfmt main.rs` 对 main.rs 的代码进行格式化

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

1. Rust代码风格，使用4个空格，而非Tab制表符
2. `println!`是一个Rust macro宏指令。（具体在19章对macro进行介绍）目前只需知道带有`!`的是macro，而不是普通的funciton
3. `"Hello, world!"` 这里是`prinln!`宏指令的参数
4. Rust使用`;`表明表达式的结束位置

Rust is an *ahead-of-time compiled* language.

## 1.3 Hello, Cargo!

Cargo集成了Rust编译、包管理、二进制依赖下载等功能的工具。

> 建议配置一下cargo的环境变量，假如使用zsh：
>
> ```shell
> ## Rust - cargo
> CARGO_HOME=/Users/用户名/.cargo
> export CARGO_HOME/bin
> ```

+ 创建rust项目（会新建和项目名一致的文件夹）

  ```shell
  cargo new 项目名
  ```

  > Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change `cargo new` to use a different version control system or no version control system by using the `--vcs` flag. Run `cargo new --help` to see the available options.

+ 编译项目（生成target目录，里面产生可执行二进制文件）

  ```shell
  cargo build
  ```

  > Running `cargo build` for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top level: *Cargo.lock*. This file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the file is a bit sparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo manages its contents for you.

+ 编译且运行二进制可执行文件

  ```shell
  cargo run
  ```

+ 检查项目代码

  ```shell
  cargo check
  ```

+ 项目代码发版(release，需要更长的编译时间)

  ```shell
  cargo build --release
  ```

Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:

- We can build a project using `cargo build`.
- We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the *target/debug* directory.

> When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in *target/release* instead of *target/debug*. <u>The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile</u>. This is why there are two different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run `cargo build --release` and benchmark with the executable in *target/release*.

# 2. Programming a Guessing Game

+ [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, **UTF-8 encoded** bit of text.
+ The `::` syntax in the `::new` line indicates that `new` is an associated function of the `String` type.

+ use `break` to exit `loop`

+ `_`, is a catchall value
+ use `continue` 进入 `loop` 的下一轮循环
+ `mut` 修饰变量时，变量由默认的不可变变成可变
+ `match`关键字的使用，就类似其他语言的 `switch`

---

猜数字-参考代码：

+ main.rs

  ```rust
  use rand::Rng;
  use std::cmp::Ordering;
  use std::io;
  
  fn main() {
      println!("Guess the number!");
  
      let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
  
      loop {
          println!("Please input your guess.");
  
          let mut guess = String::new();
  
          io::stdin()
              .read_line(&mut guess)
              .expect("Failed to read line");
  
          let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
              Ok(num) => num,
              Err(_) => continue,
          };
  
          println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
  
          match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
              Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
              Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
              Ordering::Equal => {
                  println!("You win!");
                  break;
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

+ Cargo.toml

  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "just_test"
  version = "0.1.0"
  edition = "2021"
  
  # See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
  
  [dependencies]
  rand="0.8.3"
  ```

# 3. Common Programming Concepts

## 3.1 Variables and Mutability

+ 使用 `const` 声明和定义 不可变的常量

  ```rust
  const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
  ```

  > Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.
  >
  > See the [Rust Reference’s section on constant evaluation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html) for more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.

### Shadowing

Rust允许使用同一个变量名来声明新的变量。

这时候，称第一个使用该变量名的var1被第二个使用该变量名的var2给shaowed了。

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then it shadows `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so the value of `x` is then `6`. Then, within an inner scope, the third `let` statement also shadows `x`, multiplying the previous value by `2` to give `x` a value of `12`. When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and `x` returns to being `6`.

```shell
$ cargo run
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

+ `mut` 声明变量可变，但是一旦赋值后，不可以再赋值成不同的类型
+ shadowing，使用`let`另外声明一个重名的变量，并且可以赋值不同类型

```rust
// shadowing 合法，从字符串类型，到 数值类型
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();

// mut 非法，赋值成字符串类型后，不得改变类型赋值
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```

## 3.2 Data Types

Rust是强类型语言，编译器能够在编译时自动判断变量的类型。

当类型无法自动确定时，则需要用户主动声明变量的类型，例如：

`let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");`

### Scalar Type

#### Integer Types

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

> Signed numbers are stored using [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) representation.
>
> 有符号数值用二进制补码表示

> Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.

| Number literals  | Example       |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |

> **integer types default to `i32`.** 
>
> The primary situation in which you’d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

> To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:
>
> - Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`
> - Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods
> - Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods
> - Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with `saturating_*` methods

#### Floating-Point Types

Rust支持两种浮点数类型，`f32`和`f64`。这两种都是有符号的，并且默认使用`f64`作为浮点数类型。（因为现代CPU处理`f64`和`f32`的速度相差无几，并且`f64`精度要更高）

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

> Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

#### Numeric Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

#### The Boolean Type

Boolean，只有`true`和`false`，仅占用1 byte。

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

#### The Character Type

Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here’s some examples of declaring `char` values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'ℤ';
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```

> Rust’s `char` type is **four bytes** in size and represents a **Unicode** Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 

### Compound Types

*Compound types* can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### The Tuple Type

Tuple类型，可以聚合多种类型为一体，但是一旦声明后，不可修改声明中包含的类型和数量。

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

> The tuple without any values, `()`, is a special type that has only one value, also written `()`. 
>
> The type is called the *unit type* and the value is called the *unit value*. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.

#### The Array Type

Array，里面的元素类型必须一致，并且数组的长度是固定的。

> A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that *is* allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. [Chapter 8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-01-vectors.html) discusses vectors in more detail.

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
//等同于 let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
```

##### Accessing Array Elements

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

##### Invalid Array Element Access

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!(
        "The value of the element at index {} is: {}",
        index, element
    );
}
```

如果输入的数字大于4，就会抛出异常。

```shell
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

## 3.3 Functions

使用`fn`关键字声明函数

```rust
fn 函数名(参数声明) -> 返回值声明 { 函数体 }
```

```rutst
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

> Rust对函数声明的位置没有严格要求。（不像C需要在之前声明函数，后面的代码才能使用）。

### Parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Rust中，函数的所有参数的类型，必须显式声明。

### Statements and Expressions

+ *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do **not return a value**. 
+ *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value. 

Let’s look at some examples.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

> Listing 3-1: A `main` function declaration containing one statement.
>
> Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
```

以上语句会得到Error，因为`let y = 6` 是 statement，而不是expression，没有返回值，所以不能再给`x`赋值。

Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that you’ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which is an expression that evaluates to the value `11`. Expressions can be part of statements: in Listing 3-1, the `6` in the statement `let y = 6;` is an expression that evaluates to the value `6`. **Calling a function is an expression**. **Calling a macro is an expression**. **A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression**, for example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

This expression：

```rust
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```

is a block that, in this case, evaluates to `4`. That value gets bound to `y` as part of the `let` statement. Note that the `x + 1` line doesn’t have a semicolon at the end, unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. **Expressions do not include ending semicolons**. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.

### Functions with Return Values

Functions can return values to the code that calls them. **We don’t name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (`->`)**. 

In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with **the value of the final expression** in the block of the body of a function. 

You can return early from a function by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. Here’s an example of a function that returns a value:

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

## 3.4 Comments

使用`//`

## 3.5 Control Flow

### `if` Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

> It’s also worth noting that **the condition in this code *must* be a `bool`**. If the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error. For example, try running the following code:

#### Handling Multiple Conditions with `else if`

You can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if` expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

> Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.

#### Using `if` in a `let` Statement

**因为`if`是expression**，所以我们可以使用`if`来给`let`变量赋值。

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

**`if`和`else`的返回值类型必须一致**

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

When we try to compile this code, we’ll get an error. The `if` and `else` arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to find the problem in the program:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: `if` and `else` have incompatible types
 --> src/main.rs:4:44
  |
4 |     let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
  |                                 -          ^^^^^ expected integer, found `&str`
  |                                 |
  |                                 expected because of this

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `branches` due to previous error
```

### Repetition with Loops

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Let’s try each one.

#### Repeating Code with `loop`

If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally specify a *loop label* on a loop that we can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Here’s an example with two nested loops:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {}", count);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {}", remaining);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {}", count);
}
```

The outer loop has the label `'counting_up`, and it will count up from 0 to 2. The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first `break` that doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The `break 'counting_up;` statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s
     Running `target/debug/loops`
count = 0
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 1
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 2
remaining = 10
End count = 2
```

#### Returning Values from Loops

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do this, **you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the loop**; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it, as shown here:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

Finally, we print the value in `result`, which in this case is 20.

#### Conditional Loops with `while`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
// 3-4
```

As a more concise alternative, you can use a `for` loop and execute some code for each item in a collection. A `for` loop looks like the code in Listing 3-5.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
// 3-5
```

Using the `for` loop, you wouldn’t need to remember to change any other code if you changed the number of values in the array, as you would with the method used in Listing 3-4.

# 4. Understanding Ownership

Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. **It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector**, so it’s important to understand how ownership works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as several related features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.

## 4.1 What Is OwnerShip?

***Ownership* is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory**.

All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running. 

+ Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no-longer used memory as the program runs; 
+ in other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory. 
+ **Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile**. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.

> Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!

### The Stack and the Heap

Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief explanation in preparation.

Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as *last in, first out*. Think of a stack of plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called *pushing onto the stack*, and removing data is called *popping off the stack*. **All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size**. **Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead**.

The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a *pointer*, which is the address of that location. This process is called *allocating on the heap* and is sometimes abbreviated as just *allocating*. Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to find you.

**Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack**. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.

**Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there**. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.

**When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack**.

Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses. <u>Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the stack and the heap very often, but knowing that **the main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data** can help explain why it works the way it does</u>.

### Ownership Rules

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

- **Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.**
- **There can only be one owner at a time**.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

#### Variable Scope

```rust
{                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
  let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

  // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

#### The `String` Type

You can create a `String` from a string literal using the `from` function, like so：

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace this particular `from` function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like `string_from`. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the [“Method Syntax”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax) section of Chapter 5 and when we talk about namespacing with modules in [“Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html) in Chapter 7.

This kind of string *can* be mutated:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

So, what’s the difference here? Why can `String` be mutated but literals cannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.

#### Memory and Allocation

With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:

- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our `String`.

That first part is done by us: when we call `String::from`, its implementation requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming languages.

However, the second part is different. In languages with a *garbage collector (GC)*, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC, it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and call code to explicitly return it, just as we did to request it. Doing this correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget, we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with exactly one `free`.

**Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope**. Here’s a version of our scope example from Listing 4-1 using a `String` instead of a string literal:

```rust
{
  let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

  // do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
// longer valid
```

There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our `String` needs to the allocator: when `s` goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop), and it’s where the author of `String` can put the code to return the memory. **Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly bracket**.

#### Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move

Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust. Let’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
//Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable x to y
```

We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value `5` to `x`; then **make a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`.**” We now have two variables, `x` and `y`, and both equal `5`. This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5` values are pushed onto the stack.

Now let’s look at the `String` version:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

<u>This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in `s1` and bind it to `s2`. But this isn’t quite what happens</u>.

Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to `String` under the covers. <u>A `String` is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity. **This group of data is stored on the stack**. **On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents**</u>.

![String in memory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-01.svg)

Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a String holding the value "hello" bound to s1

> The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` is currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the `String` has received from the allocator. The difference between length and capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore the capacity.

**When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to**. In other words, the data representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.

![s1 and s2 pointing to the same value](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-02.svg)

Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable `s2` that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of `s1`

**The representation does *not* look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large**.

![s1 and s2 to two places](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-03.svg)

Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what `s2 = s1` might do if Rust copied the heap data as well

Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the `drop` function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. **This is a problem: when `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a *double free* error and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously**. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

**To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1`, Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when `s1` goes out of scope**. Check out what happens when you try to use `s1` after `s2` is created; it won’t work:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the invalidated reference:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
2 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |              -- value moved here
4 | 
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value borrowed here after move

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

If you’ve heard the terms *shallow copy* and *deep copy* while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. **But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling it a shallow copy, it’s known as a *move***. In this example, we would say that `s1` was *moved* into `s2`. So what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.

![s1 moved to s2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-04.svg)

Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after `s1` has been invalidated

That solves our problem! With only `s2` valid, when it goes out of scope, it alone will free the memory, and we’re done.

**In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any *automatic* copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance**.

#### Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone

**If we *do* want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`**. We’ll discuss method syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.

Here’s an example of the `clone` method in action:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3, where the heap data *does* get copied.

#### Stack-Only Data: Copy

There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using integers – part of which was shown in Listing 4-2 – works and is valid:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn’t moved into `y`.

**The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make**. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being valid after we create the variable `y`. I**n other words, there’s no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn’t do anything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out**.

**Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack like integers are (we’ll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type implements the `Copy` trait, a variable is still valid after assignment to another variable**. <u>Rust won’t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the `Copy` annotation to your type to implement the trait, see [“Derivable Traits”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html) in Appendix C</u>.

So what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but **as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`**. Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- **Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not**.

#### Ownership and Functions

The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to those for assigning a value to a variable. **Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does**. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations showing where variables go into and out of scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope annotated

If we tried to use `s` after the call to `takes_ownership`, Rust would throw a compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding code to `main` that uses `s` and `x` to see where you can use them and where the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.

#### Return Values and Scope

**Returning values can also transfer ownership**. Listing 4-4 shows an example of a function that returns some value, with similar annotations as those in Listing 4-3.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

**The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless ownership of the data has been moved to another variable**.

While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

<u>Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple</u>, as shown in Listing 4-5.

````rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
````

Listing 4-5: Returning ownership of parameters

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. Luckily for us, **Rust has a feature for using a value without transferring ownership, called *references***.

## 4.2 References and Borrowing

A *reference* is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access data stored at that address that is owned by some other variable. **Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type**. Here is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into `calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than `String`. These ampersands represent *references*, and they allow you to refer to some value **without taking ownership of it**. Figure 4-5 depicts this concept.

![&String s pointing at String s1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-05.svg)

Figure 4-5: A diagram of `&String s` pointing at `String s1`

> Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is *dereferencing*, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We’ll see some uses of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in Chapter 15.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter `s` is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
```

**The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameter’s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped when `s` stops being used because `s` doesn’t have ownership**. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

**We call the action of creating a reference *borrowing***. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back. You don’t own it.

### Mutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

First, we change `s` to be `mut`. Then we create a mutable reference with `&mut s` where we call the `change` function, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`. This makes it very clear that the `change` function will mutate the value it borrows.

**Mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time**. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```

**The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion**. It’s something that new Rustaceans struggle with, because most languages let you mutate whenever you’d like. **<u>The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time</u>**. A *data race* is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

**Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races**!

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not *simultaneous* ones:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
  let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;
```

**Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references**. This code results in an error:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```

Here’s the error:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |              -- immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |              ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | 
8 |     println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
  |                                -- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

Whew! **We *also* cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.** Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the value to suddenly change out from under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s reading of the data.

Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used. **For instance, this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the `println!`, occurs before the mutable reference is introduced**:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
// variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
println!("{}", r3);
```

The scopes of the immutable references `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!` where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference `r3` is created. **These scopes don’t overlap, so this code is allowed**. The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called *Non-Lexical Lifetimes* (NLL for short), and you can read more about it in [The Edition Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/ownership-and-lifetimes/non-lexical-lifetimes.html).

### Dangling References

In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a *dangling pointer*--a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else--by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. **In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does**.

Let’s try to create a dangling reference to see how Rust prevents them with a compile-time error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}
```

Here’s the error:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier

  |

  |                ^^^^^^^^

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0106`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

Let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s happening at each stage of our `dangle` code:

```rust
fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
```

Because `s` is created inside `dangle`, when the code of `dangle` is finished, `s` will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid `String`. That’s no good! Rust won’t let us do this.

The solution here is to return the `String` directly:

```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```

This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is deallocated.

### The Rules of References

Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

- **At any given time, you can have *either* one mutable reference *or* any number of immutable references.**
- **References must always be valid**.

Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.

## 4.3 The Slice Type

*Slices* let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. **A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership**.

### String Slices

A *string slice* is a reference to part of a `String`, and it looks like this:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```

Rather than a reference to the entire `String`, `hello` is a reference to a portion of the `String`, specified in the extra `[0..5]` bit. We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying `[starting_index..ending_index]`, where `starting_index` is the first position in the slice and `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice. Internally, **the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which corresponds to `ending_index` minus `starting_index`**. So in the case of `let world = &s[6..11];`, `world` would be a slice that contains a pointer to the byte at index 6 of `s` with a length value of 5.

Figure 4-6 shows this in a diagram.

![world containing a pointer to the byte at index 6 of String s and a length 5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-06.svg)

Figure 4-6: String slice referring to part of a `String`

With Rust’s `..` range syntax, if you want to start at index zero, you can drop the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
```

By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the `String`, you can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
```

You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these are equal:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];
```

> Note: **String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries**. **If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a multibyte character, your program will exit with an error**. For the purposes of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the [“Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings) section of Chapter 8.

With all this information in mind, let’s rewrite `first_word` to return a slice. The type that signifies “string slice” is written as `&str`:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

We now have a straightforward API that’s much harder to mess up, because the compiler will ensure the references into the `String` remain valid. Remember the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the end of the first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was logically incorrect but didn’t show any immediate errors. The problems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with our code much sooner. Using the slice version of `first_word` will throw a compile-time error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    s.clear(); // error!

    println!("the first word is: {}", word);
}
```

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/main.rs:18:5
   |
16 |     let word = first_word(&s);
   |                           -- immutable borrow occurs here
17 | 
18 |     s.clear(); // error!
   |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
19 | 
20 |     println!("the first word is: {}", word);
   |                                       ---- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because `clear` needs to truncate the `String`, it needs to get a mutable reference. **The `println!` after the call to `clear` uses the reference in `word`, so the immutable reference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable reference in `clear` and the immutable reference in `word` from existing at the same time, and compilation fails**. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use, but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!

#### String Literals Are Slices

Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:

```rust
let s = "Hello, world!";
```

**The type of `s` here is `&str`: it’s a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; `&str` is an immutable reference**.

#### String Slices as Parameters

Knowing that you can take slices of literals and `String` values leads us to one more improvement on `first_word`, and that’s its signature:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
```

A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9 instead because it allows us to use the same function on both `&String` values and `&str` values.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
```

Listing 4-9: Improving the `first_word` function by using a string slice for the type of the `s` parameter

If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a `String`, we can pass a slice of the `String` or a reference to the `String`. This flexibility takes advantage of *deref coercions*, a feature we will cover in the [“Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html#implicit-deref-coercions-with-functions-and-methods) section of Chapter 15. Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a `String` makes our API more general and useful without losing any functionality:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");

    // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
    // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
    // to whole slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&my_string);

    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or whole
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

    // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
```

### Other Slices

String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a more general slice type, too. Consider this array:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array. We’d do so like this:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
```

This slice has the type `&[i32]`. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.

### Summary

The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your memory usage in the same way as other systems programming languages, but having the owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means you don’t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.

Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we’ll talk about these concepts further throughout the rest of the book. Let’s move on to Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a `struct`.

# 5. Using Structs to Structure Related Data

A *struct*, or *structure*, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a *struct* is like an object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with structs. We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how to define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions called *methods*, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking.

## 5.1 Defining and Instantiating Structs

we define the names and types of the pieces of data, which we call *fields*.

```rust
struct User {
  active: bool,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

实例化struct时，不需要严格按照声明`fields`的顺序给字段赋值。

```rust
let user1 = User {
  email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
  username: String::from("someusername123"),
  active: true,
  sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

当struct实例声明为可变`mut`时，可以对里面的字段重新赋值。

```rust
let mut user1 = User {
  email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
  username: String::from("someusername123"),
  active: true,
  sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
```

> **注意：Rust不允许声明部分fields可变mutable，只能声明整个实例可变**。

Struct实例作为函数返回值-用例：

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
  User {
    email: email,
    username: username,
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
  }
}
```

### Using the Field Init Shorthand when Variables and Fields Have the Same Name

 we can use the *field init shorthand* syntax to rewrite `build_user` so that it behaves exactly the same but doesn’t have the repetition of `email` and `username`.

当参数名和Struct字段名一致时，可以使用Struct支持的*filed init shorthand* syntax，直接给Struct实例的字段赋值，如下：

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
  User {
    email,
    username,
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
  }
}
```

### Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

如果创建新的Struct实例，与已有的Struct实例仅部分字段值不同，则可以使用*struct update syntax*。

当我们不使用*struct update syntax*时，申明一个类似user1的Struct实例，需要如下操作：

```rust
let user2 = User {
  active: user1.active,
  username: user1.username,
  email: String::from("another@example.com"),
  sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

```rust
let user2 = User {
  email: String::from("another@example.com"),
  ..user1
};
```

Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set a new `email` value for a `User` instance but use the rest of the values from `user1`

注意，由于*move*所有权的原因，这里user2中两个没有实现`Copy` **trait**的字段（email和username），其中一个字段username是从user1那move过来的，所以导致user1不能再访问（所有权让给user2了）。除非这里emaiil和username都是user2自己重新赋值的，那么剩下的两个字段（active、sign_in_count）由于都实现了`Copy` **trait**，所以是copy过来的，user1就还能访问。

> **Note that the struct update syntax is like assignment with `=` because it moves the data**, just as we saw in the [“Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move” section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-move). **In this example, we can no longer use `user1` after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`**. If we had given `user2` new `String` values for both `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count` values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`. **The types of `active` and `sign_in_count` are types that implement the `Copy` trait**, so the behavior we discussed in the [“Stack-Only Data: Copy” section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy) would apply.

### Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types

To define a tuple struct, start with the `struct` keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here are definitions and usages of two tuple structs named `Color` and `Point`:

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

注意，这里Color和Point虽然拥有同样的字段类型的定义，但不是同一种类型。一个Struct就是一个类型。

tuple struct和tuple类型，都可以通过`.`和下标来访问字段。

### Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields

就像Unit Tuple`()`似的，Rust也允许定义没有字段的Struct `struct 名;`。

You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called *unit-like structs* because they behave similarly to `()`, the unit type that we mentioned in [“The Tuple Type”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type) section.

**Unit-like structs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself**. We’ll discuss traits in Chapter 10.  

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

Imagine we’ll be implementing behavior for this type that every instance is always equal to every instance of every other type, perhaps to have a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn’t need any data to implement that behavior!

### Ownership of Struct Data

In the `User` struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned `String` type rather than the `&str` string slice type. This is a deliberate choice because we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.

**It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of *lifetimes***, a Rust feature that we’ll discuss in Chapter 10. **Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.** Let’s say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like this, which won’t work:

```rust
struct User {
  username: &str,
  email: &str,
  sign_in_count: u64,
  active: bool,
}

fn main() {
  let user1 = User {
    email: "someone@example.com",
    username: "someusername123",
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
  };
}
```

```shell
The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:


$ cargo run
   Compiling structs v0.1.0 (file:///projects/structs)

In Chapter 10, we’ll discuss how to fix these errors so you can store references in structs, but for now, we’ll fix errors like these using owned types like String instead of references like &str.
```

## 5.2 An Example Program Using Structs

最原始的计算宽高乘积，直接使用function

```rust
fn main() {
  let width1 = 30;
  let height1 = 50;

  println!(
    "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
    area(width1, height1)
  );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
  width * height
}
```

### Refactoring with Tuples

使用1个tuple代替原本的两个入参，然而这样两个参数没有名字，可读性降低。

```rust
fn main() {
  let rect1 = (30, 50);

  println!(
    "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
    area(rect1)
  );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
  dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
```

### Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning

使用struct实现

```rust
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  println!(
    "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
    area(&rect1)
  );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
  rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

### Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits

```rust
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  println!("rect1 is {}", rect1);
}
```

When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:

```shell
error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
```

**The `println!` macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly brackets tell `println!` to use formatting known as `Display`: output intended for direct end user consumption**. The primitive types we’ve seen so far implement `Display` by default, because there’s only one way you’d want to show a `1` or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way `println!` should format the output is less clear because there are more display possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the curly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, **Rust doesn’t try to guess what we want, and structs don’t have a provided implementation of `Display`**.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
}
```

Now when we run the program, we won’t get any errors, and we’ll see the following output:

```rust
$ cargo run
Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
  Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
  Running `target/debug/rectangles`
  rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
```

When we use the `{:#?}` style in the example, the output will look like this:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
```

Another way to print out a value using the `Debug` format is by using the [`dbg!` macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html) . **The `dbg!` macro takes ownership of an expression, prints the file and line number of where that `dbg!` macro call occurs in your code along with the resulting value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value**. Calling the `dbg!` macro prints to the standard error console stream (`stderr`), as opposed to `println!` which prints to the standard output console stream (`stdout`). We’ll talk more about `stderr` and `stdout` in the [“Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output” section in Chapter 12](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-06-writing-to-stderr-instead-of-stdout.html). Here’s an example where we’re interested in the value that gets assigned to the `width` field, as well as the value of the whole struct in `rect1`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

fn main() {
  let scale = 2;
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: dbg!(30 * scale),
    height: 50,
  };

  dbg!(&rect1);
}
```

We can put `dbg!` around the expression `30 * scale` and, because `dbg!` returns ownership of the expression’s value, the `width` field will get the same value as if we didn’t have the `dbg!` call there. We don’t want `dbg!` to take ownership of `rect1`, so we use a reference to `dbg!` in the next call. Here’s what the output of this example looks like:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
[src/main.rs:10] 30 * scale = 60
[src/main.rs:14] &rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
```

We can see the first bit of output came from *src/main.rs* line 10, where we’re debugging the expression `30 * scale`, and its resulting value is 60 (the `Debug` formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The `dbg!` call on line 14 of *src/main.rs* outputs the value of `&rect1`, which is the `Rectangle` struct. This output uses the pretty `Debug` formatting of the `Rectangle` type. The `dbg!` macro can be really helpful when you’re trying to figure out what your code is doing!

> In addition to the `Debug` trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us to use with the `derive` attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in [Appendix C](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html). We’ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many attributes other than `derive`; for more information, see [the “Attributes” section of the Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html).

## 5.3 Method Syntax

method和function类似的，都是以`fn`声明，并且接受参数，可以有返回值。不同的是，**methods定义在struct（或enum或trait object，Chapters6 and Chapters17）的上下文中，并且第一个参数永远是self，表示struct实例自身**。

### Defining Methods

Let’s change the `area` function that has a `Rectangle` instance as a parameter and instead make an `area` **method** defined on the `Rectangle` struct, as shown in Listing 5-13.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
    self.width * self.height
  }
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  println!(
    "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
    rect1.area()
  );
}
```

Listing 5-13: Defining an `area` method on the `Rectangle` struct

To define the function within the context of `Rectangle`, we start an `impl` (implementation) block for `Rectangle`. **Everything within this `impl` block will be associated with the `Rectangle` type**. Then we move the `area` function within the `impl` curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only) parameter to be `self` in the signature and everywhere within the body. In `main`, where we called the `area` function and passed `rect1` as an argument, we can instead use *method syntax* to call the `area` method on our `Rectangle` instance. The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.

In the signature for `area`, we use `&self` instead of `rectangle: &Rectangle`. **The `&self` is actually short for `self: &Self`. Within an `impl` block, the type `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for**. **<u>Methods must have a parameter named `self` of type `Self` for their first parameter, so Rust lets you abbreviate this with only the name `self` in the first parameter spot</u>**. Note that we still need to use the `&` in front of the `self` shorthand to indicate this method borrows the `Self` instance, just as we did in `rectangle: &Rectangle`. Methods can take ownership of `self`, borrow `self` immutably as we’ve done here, or borrow `self` mutably, just as they can any other parameter.

这里使用`&self`和function版本`&Rectangle`类似的，不获取实例的所有权。**如果我们需要修改实例，则使用`&mut self`作为第一个参数**。

Rust允许声明一个和struct字段名一致的method方法，如下method和field都存在`width`：

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn width(&self) -> bool {
    self.width > 0
  }
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  if rect1.width() {
    println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
  }
}
```

>  **Where’s the `->` Operator?**
>
> In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: you use `.` if you’re calling a method on the object directly and `->` if you’re calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the pointer first. In other words, if `object` is a pointer, `object->something()` is similar to `(*object).something()`.
>
> Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the `->` operator; **instead, Rust has a feature called *automatic referencing and dereferencing***. Calling methods is one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.
>
> Here’s how it works: when you call a method with `object.something()`, **Rust automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so `object` matches the signature of the method**. In other words, the following are the same:

> The first one looks much cleaner. **This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a clear receiver—the type of `self`**. Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`). **The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice**.

### Methods with More Parameters

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
    self.width * self.height
  }

  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
    self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };
  let rect2 = Rectangle {
    width: 10,
    height: 40,
  };
  let rect3 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 45,
  };

  println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
  println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
}
```

### Associated Functions

**All functions defined within an `impl` block are called *associated functions* because they’re associated with the type named after the `impl`**. 

**We can define associated functions that don’t have `self` as their first parameter (and thus are not methods) because they don’t need an instance of the type to work with**. We’ve already used one function like this, the `String::from` function, that’s defined on the `String` type.

Associated functions that aren’t methods are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct.

Associated Functions经常用于对象的构造函数

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
    Rectangle {
      width: size,
      height: size,
    }
  }
}
```

**To call this associated function, we use the `::` syntax with the struct name**; `let sq = Rectangle::square(3);` is an example. This function is namespaced by the struct: **the `::` syntax is used for both associated functions and namespaces created by modules**. We’ll discuss modules in Chapter 7.

### Multiple `impl` Blocks

Each struct is allowed to have multiple `impl` blocks. For example, Listing 5-15 is equivalent to the code shown in Listing 5-16, which has each method in its own `impl` block.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
    self.width * self.height
  }
}

impl Rectangle {
  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
    self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```

Listing 5-16: Rewriting Listing 5-15 using multiple `impl` blocks

There’s no reason to separate these methods into multiple `impl` blocks here, but this is valid syntax. We’ll see a case in which multiple `impl` blocks are useful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types and traits.

# 6. Enums and Pattern Matching

In this chapter we’ll look at *enumerations*, also referred to as *enums*. Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible *variants*. First, we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called `Option`, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we’ll look at how pattern matching in the `match` expression makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the `if let` construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to you to handle enums in your code.

Enums are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities differ in each language. Rust’s enums are most similar to *algebraic data types* in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.

## 6.1 Defining an Enum

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
  V4,
  V6,
}
```

`IpAddrKind` is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

### Enum Values

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
  V4,
  V6,
}

struct IpAddr {
  kind: IpAddrKind,
  address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
  kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
  address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
  kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
  address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

Listing 6-1: Storing the data and `IpAddrKind` variant of an IP address using a `struct`

We can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just an enum, rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into each enum variant. This new definition of the `IpAddr` enum says that both `V4` and `V6` variants will have associated `String` values:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(String),
  V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

**There’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data**. Version four type IP addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store `V4` addresses as four `u8` values but still express `V6` addresses as one `String` value, we wouldn’t be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
  V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

We’ve shown several different ways to define data structures to store version four and version six IP addresses. However, as it turns out, wanting to store IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that [the standard library has a definition we can use!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.IpAddr.html) Let’s look at how the standard library defines `IpAddr`: it has the exact enum and variants that we’ve defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in the form of two different structs, which are defined differently for each variant:

```rust

struct Ipv4Addr {
  // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
  // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
  V4(Ipv4Addr),
  V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
```

> This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant: strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than what you might come up with.
>
> **Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for `IpAddr`, we can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we haven’t brought the standard library’s definition into our scope**. We’ll talk more about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.

Let’s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide variety of types embedded in its variants.

```rust
enum Message {
  Quit,
  Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
  Write(String),
  ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

Listing 6-2: A `Message` enum whose variants each store different amounts and types of values

This enum has four variants with different types:

- `Quit` has no data associated with it at all.
- `Move` has named fields like a struct does.
- `Write` includes a single `String`.
- `ChangeColor` includes three `i32` values.

Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to defining different kinds of struct definitions, <u>except the enum doesn’t use the `struct` keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the `Message` type</u>. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum variants hold:

```rust
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
```

<u>But if we used the different structs, which each have their own type, we couldn’t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as we could with the `Message` enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type</u>.

There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to define methods on structs using `impl`, **we’re also able to define methods on enums**. Here’s a method named `call` that we could define on our `Message` enum:

```rust
impl Message {
  fn call(&self) {
    // method body would be defined here
  }
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
m.call();
```

Let’s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and useful: `Option`.

### The `Option` Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values

**This section explores a case study of `Option`, which is another enum defined by the standard library**. The `Option` type is used in many places because it encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing.

**Rust doesn’t have the null feature that many other languages have.** *Null* is a value that means there is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of two states: null or not-null.

The problem isn’t really with the concept but with the particular implementation. As such, **Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is `Option<T>`**, and it is [defined by the standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html) as follows:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  None,
  Some(T),
}
```

The `Option<T>` enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly. **In addition, so are its variants: you can use `Some` and `None` directly without the `Option::` prefix**. **The `Option<T>` enum is still just a regular enum, and `Some(T)` and `None` are still variants of type `Option<T>`**.

The `<T>` syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a generic type parameter, and we’ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10. For now, all you need to know is that `<T>` means the `Some` variant of the `Option` enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each concrete type that gets used in place of `T` makes the overall `Option<T>` type a different type. Here are some examples of using `Option` values to hold number types and string types:

```rust
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_string = Some("a string");

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```

**The type of `some_number` is `Option<i32>`. The type of `some_string` is `Option<&str>`, which is a different type. Rust can infer these types because we’ve specified a value inside the `Some` variant**. For `absent_number`, Rust requires us to annotate the overall `Option` type: the compiler can’t infer the type that the corresponding `Some` variant will hold by looking only at a `None` value. Here, we tell Rust that we mean for `absent_number` to be of type `Option<i32>`.

When we have a `Some` value, we know that a value is present and the value is held within the `Some`. When we have a `None` value, in some sense, it means the same thing as null: we don’t have a valid value. So why is having `Option<T>` any better than having null?

**In short, because `Option<T>` and `T` (where `T` can be any type) are different types, the compiler won’t let us use an `Option<T>` value as if it were definitely a valid value**. For example, this code won’t compile because it’s trying to add an `i8` to an `Option<i8>`:

```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = x + y;
```

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling enums v0.1.0 (file:///projects/enums)
error[E0277]: cannot add `Option<i8>` to `i8`
 --> src/main.rs:5:17
  |

  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option<i8>`
  |
  = help: the trait `Add<Option<i8>>` is not implemented for `i8`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
error: could not compile `enums` due to previous error
```

Not having to worry about incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value `Option<T>`. Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case when the value is null. **<u>Everywhere that a value has a type that isn’t an `Option<T>`, you *can* safely assume that the value isn’t null</u>**. This was a deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust code.

> So, how do you get the `T` value out of a `Some` variant when you have a value of type `Option<T>` so you can use that value? The `Option<T>` enum has a large number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check them out in [its documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html). Becoming familiar with the methods on `Option<T>` will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.

## 6.2 The `match` Control Flow Operator

**Rust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called `match` that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches**. <u>Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different kinds of patterns and what they do</u>. The power of `match` comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled.

```rust
enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
  }
}
```

Listing 6-3: An enum and a `match` expression that has the variants of the enum as its patterns

When the `match` expression executes, it compares the resulting value against the pattern of each arm, in order. **If a pattern matches the value, the code associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn’t match the value, execution continues to the next arm**, much as in a coin-sorting machine. We can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our `match` has four arms.

*(类似其他语言的case switch，但是不用手动break)*

**The code associated with each arm is an expression**, and the resulting value of the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the entire `match` expression.

Curly brackets typically aren’t used if the match arm code is short, as it is in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. **If you want to run multiple lines of code in a match arm, you can use curly brackets.** For example, the following code would print “Lucky penny!” every time the method was called with a `Coin::Penny` but would still return the last value of the block, `1`:

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => {
      println!("Lucky penny!");
      1
    }
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
  }
}
```

### Patterns that Bind to Values

Another useful feature of match arms is that **they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern**. This is how we can extract values out of enum variants.

As an example, let’s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it. From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state designs, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to our `enum` by changing the `Quarter` variant to include a `UsState` value stored inside it, which we’ve done here in Listing 6-4.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
  Alabama,
  Alaska,
  // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter(UsState),
}
```

Listing 6-4: A `Coin` enum in which the `Quarter` variant also holds a `UsState` value

In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called `state` to the pattern that matches values of the variant `Coin::Quarter`. **When a `Coin::Quarter` matches, the `state` variable will bind to the value of that quarter’s state**. Then we can use `state` in the code for that arm, like so:

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter(state) => {
      println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
      25
    }
  }
}
```

### Matching with `Option<T>`

In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner `T` value out of the `Some` case when using `Option<T>`; we can also handle `Option<T>` using `match` as we did with the `Coin` enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll compare the variants of `Option<T>`, but the way that the `match` expression works remains the same.

Let’s say we want to write a function that takes an `Option<i32>` and, if there’s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn’t a value inside, the function should return the `None` value and not attempt to perform any operations.

This function is very easy to write, thanks to `match`, and will look like Listing 6-5.

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
  match x {
    None => None,
    Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
  }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```

Listing 6-5: A function that uses a `match` expression on an `Option<i32>`

Combining `match` and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this pattern a lot in Rust code: `match` against an enum, bind a variable to the data inside, and then execute code based on it. It’s a bit tricky at first, but once you get used to it, you’ll wish you had it in all languages. It’s consistently a user favorite.

### Matches Are Exhaustive

There’s one other aspect of `match` we need to discuss. Consider this version of our `plus_one` function that has a bug and won’t compile:

```rust
    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }
```

We didn’t handle the `None` case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this error:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling enums v0.1.0 (file:///projects/enums)
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered
   --> src/main.rs:3:15
    |
3   |         match x {
    |               ^ pattern `None` not covered
    |
    = help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled, possibly by adding wildcards or more match arms
    = note: the matched value is of type `Option<i32>`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0004`.
error: could not compile `enums` due to previous error
```

Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are *exhaustive*: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of `Option<T>`, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the `None` case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.

### Catch-all Patterns and the `_` Placeholder

Let’s look at an example where we want to take special actions for a few particular values, but for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a game where if you get a value of 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move, but instead gets a new fancy hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s a `match` that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by functions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for this example:

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
  3 => add_fancy_hat(),
  7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
  other => move_player(other),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```

For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values 3 and 7. **For the last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the variable we’ve chosen to name `other`.** The code that runs for the `other` arm uses the variable by passing it to the `move_player` function.

This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a `u8` can have, because **the last pattern will match all values not specifically listed**. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that `match` must be exhaustive. **<u>Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the patterns are evaluated in order. Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all because those later arms would never match!</u>**

**Rust also has a pattern we can use when we don’t want to use the value in the catch-all pattern: `_`, which is a special pattern that matches any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t going to use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable**.

Let’s change the rules of the game to be that if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7, you must roll again. **We don’t need to use the value in that case, so we can change our code to use `_` instead of the variable named `other`**:

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
  3 => add_fancy_hat(),
  7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
  _ => reroll(),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn reroll() {}
```

If we change the rules of the game one more time, so that nothing else happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7, we can express that by using **the unit value** (the empty tuple type we mentioned in [“The Tuple Type”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type) section) as the code that goes with the `_` arm:

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
  3 => add_fancy_hat(),
  7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
  _ => (),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
```

There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in [Chapter 18](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html). For now, we’re going to move on to the `if let` syntax, which can be useful in situations where the `match` expression is a bit wordy.

## 6.3 Concise Control Flow with `if let`

**The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.** Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an `Option<u8>` value in the `config_max` variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the `Some` variant.

```rust
fn main() {
  let config_max = Some(3u8);
  match config_max {
    Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
    _ => (),
  }
}
```

Listing 6-6: A `match` that only cares about executing code when the value is `Some`

If the value is `Some`, we want to print out the value in the `Some` variant, which we do by binding the value to the variable `max` in the pattern. We don’t want to do anything with the `None` value. To satisfy the `match` expression, we have to add `_ => ()` after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`. The following code behaves the same as the `match` in Listing 6-6:

```rust
fn main() {
  let config_max = Some(3u8);
  if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
  }
}
```

**The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the `match` and the pattern is its first arm**. In this case, the pattern is `Some(max)`, and the `max` binds to the value inside the `Some`. We can then use `max` in the body of the `if let` block in the same way as we used `max` in the corresponding `match` arm. The code in the `if let` block isn’t run if the value doesn’t match the pattern.

> Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However, you lose the exhaustive checking that `match` enforces. Choosing between `match` and `if let` depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.

**In other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values**.

**We can include an `else` with an `if let`. The block of code that goes with the `else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the `match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`**. Recall the `Coin` enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the `Quarter` variant also held a `UsState` value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a `match` expression like this:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
  Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
  _ => count += 1,
}
```

Or we could use an `if let` and `else` expression like this:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
  println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
  count += 1;
}
```

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to express using a `match`, remember that `if let` is in your Rust toolbox as well.

# 7. Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

The programs we’ve written so far have been in one module in one file. As a project grows, you can organize code by splitting it into multiple modules and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into separate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter covers all these techniques. For very large projects of a set of interrelated packages that evolve together, Cargo provides workspaces, which we’ll cover in the [“Cargo Workspaces”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) section in Chapter 14.

Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the *module system*, include:

- **Packages:** A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
- **Crates:** A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- **Modules** and **use:** Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
- **Paths:** A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

## 7.1 Packages and Crates

The first parts of the module system we’ll cover are packages and crates. A crate is a binary or library. The *crate root* is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in the [“Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html) section). A *package* is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a *Cargo.toml* file that describes how to build those crates.

Several rules determine what a package can contain. **A package can contain at most one library crate. It can contain as many binary crates as you’d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary)**.

Let’s walk through what happens when we create a package. First, we enter the command `cargo new`:

```shell
$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
```

When we entered the command, Cargo created a *Cargo.toml* file, giving us a **package**. Looking at the contents of *Cargo.toml*, there’s no mention of *src/main.rs* because Cargo follows a convention that ***src/main.rs* is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package**. Likewise, Cargo knows that **if the package directory contains *src/lib.rs*, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and *src/lib.rs* is its crate root**. Cargo passes the crate root files to `rustc` to build the library or binary.

Here, we have a package that only contains *src/main.rs*, meaning it only contains a binary crate named `my-project`. <u>If a package contains *src/main.rs* and *src/lib.rs*, it has two crates: a library and a binary, both with the same name as the package</u>. **A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the *src/bin* directory: each file will be a separate binary crate**.

A crate will group related functionality together in a scope so the functionality is easy to share between multiple projects. For example, the `rand` crate we used in [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number) provides functionality that generates random numbers. We can use that functionality in our own projects by bringing the `rand` crate into our project’s scope. All the functionality provided by the `rand` crate is accessible through the crate’s name, `rand`.

<u>Keeping a crate’s functionality in its own scope clarifies whether particular functionality is defined in our crate or the `rand` crate and prevents potential conflicts</u>. For example, the `rand` crate provides a trait named `Rng`. We can also define a `struct` named `Rng` in our own crate. Because a crate’s functionality is namespaced in its own scope, when we add `rand` as a dependency, the compiler isn’t confused about what the name `Rng` refers to. <u>In our crate, it refers to the `struct Rng` that we defined. We would access the `Rng` trait from the `rand` crate as `rand::Rng`</u>.

Let’s move on and talk about the module system!

## 7.2 Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

In this section, we’ll talk about modules and other parts of the module system, namely *paths* that allow you to name items; the `use` keyword that brings a path into scope; and the `pub` keyword to make items public. We’ll also discuss the `as` keyword, external packages, and the glob operator. For now, let’s focus on modules!

*Modules* let us organize code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse. **Modules also control the *privacy* of items, which is whether an item can be used by outside code (*public*) or is an internal implementation detail and not available for outside use (*private*)**.

Create a new library named `restaurant` by running `cargo new --lib restaurant`; then put the code in Listing 7-1 into *src/lib.rs* to define some modules and function signatures.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
  mod hosting {
    fn add_to_waitlist() {}

    fn seat_at_table() {}
  }

  mod serving {
    fn take_order() {}

    fn serve_order() {}

    fn take_payment() {}
  }
}
```

Listing 7-1: A `front_of_house` module containing other modules that then contain functions

We define a module by starting with the `mod` keyword and then specify the name of the module (in this case, `front_of_house`) and place curly brackets around the body of the module. Inside modules, we can have other modules, as in this case with the modules `hosting` and `serving`. Modules can also hold definitions for other items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, or—as in Listing 7-1—functions.

By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why they’re related. Programmers using this code would have an easier time finding the definitions they wanted to use because they could navigate the code based on the groups rather than having to read through all the definitions. Programmers adding new functionality to this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.

**Earlier, we mentioned that *src/main.rs* and *src/lib.rs* are called crate roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two files form a module named `crate` at the root of the crate’s module structure, known as the *module tree***.

Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.

```shell
crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
```

Listing 7-2: The module tree for the code in Listing 7-1

This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside one another (for example, `hosting` nests inside `front_of_house`). The tree also shows that some modules are *siblings* to each other, meaning they’re defined in the same module (`hosting` and `serving` are defined within `front_of_house`). To continue the family metaphor, if module A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the *child* of module B and that module B is the *parent* of module A. **Notice that the entire module tree is rooted under the implicit module named `crate`**.

The module tree might remind you of the filesystem’s directory tree on your computer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a filesystem, you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we need a way to find our modules.

## 7.3 Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. If we want to call a function, we need to know its path.

A path can take two forms:

- An ***absolute path*** starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal `crate`.
- A ***relative path*** starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.

Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (`::`).

Let’s return to the example in Listing 7-1. How do we call the `add_to_waitlist` function? This is the same as asking, what’s the path of the `add_to_waitlist` function? In Listing 7-3, we simplified our code a bit by removing some of the modules and functions. We’ll show two ways to call the `add_to_waitlist` function from a new function `eat_at_restaurant` defined in the crate root. The `eat_at_restaurant` function is part of our library crate’s public API, so we mark it with the `pub` keyword. In the [”Exposing Paths with the `pub` Keyword”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword) section, we’ll go into more detail about `pub`. Note that this example won’t compile just yet; we’ll explain why in a bit.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
  mod hosting {
    fn add_to_waitlist() {}
  }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
  // Absolute path
  crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

  // Relative path
  front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-3: Calling the `add_to_waitlist` function using absolute and relative paths

The first time we call the `add_to_waitlist` function in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use an absolute path. The `add_to_waitlist` function is defined in the same crate as `eat_at_restaurant`, which means we can use the `crate` keyword to start an absolute path.

After `crate`, we include each of the successive modules until we make our way to `add_to_waitlist`. You can imagine a filesystem with the same structure, and we’d specify the path `/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist` to run the `add_to_waitlist` program; using the `crate` name to start from the crate root is like using `/` to start from the filesystem root in your shell.

The second time we call `add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use a relative path. The path starts with `front_of_house`, the name of the module defined at the same level of the module tree as `eat_at_restaurant`. Here the filesystem equivalent would be using the path `front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist`. Starting with a name means that the path is relative.

Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you’ll make based on your project. The decision should depend on whether you’re more likely to move item definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item. For example, if we move the `front_of_house` module and the `eat_at_restaurant` function into a module named `customer_experience`, we’d need to update the absolute path to `add_to_waitlist`, but the relative path would still be valid. However, if we moved the `eat_at_restaurant` function separately into a module named `dining`, the absolute path to the `add_to_waitlist` call would stay the same, but the relative path would need to be updated. <u>Our preference is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other</u>.

Let’s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won’t compile yet! The error we get is shown in Listing 7-4.

```shell

error: could not compile `restaurant` due to 2 previous errors
```

Listing 7-4: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-3

The error messages say that module `hosting` is private. In other words, we have the correct paths for the `hosting` module and the `add_to_waitlist` function, but **Rust won’t let us use them because it doesn’t have access to the private sections**.

Modules aren’t useful only for organizing your code. They also define Rust’s *privacy boundary*: the line that encapsulates the implementation details external code isn’t allowed to know about, call, or rely on. **So, if you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module**.

**The way privacy works in Rust is that all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default**. <u>Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. The reason is that child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child modules can see the context in which they’re defined</u>. To continue with the restaurant metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant in which they operate.

Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code. But **you can expose inner parts of child modules’ code to outer ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public**.

### Exposing Paths with the `pub` Keyword

Let’s return to the error in Listing 7-4 that told us the `hosting` module is private. We want the `eat_at_restaurant` function in the parent module to have access to the `add_to_waitlist` function in the child module, so we mark the `hosting` module with the `pub` keyword, as shown in Listing 7-5.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
  pub mod hosting {
    fn add_to_waitlist() {}
  }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
  // Absolute path
  crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

  // Relative path
  front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-5: Declaring the `hosting` module as `pub` to use it from `eat_at_restaurant`

Unfortunately, the code in Listing 7-5 still results in an error, as shown in Listing 7-6.

error: could not compile `restaurant` due to 2 previous errors
```

Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-5

What happened? Adding the `pub` keyword in front of `mod hosting` makes the module public. With this change, if we can access `front_of_house`, we can access `hosting`. But the *contents* of `hosting` are still private; **making the module public doesn’t make its contents public. The `pub` keyword on a module only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it**.

The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the `add_to_waitlist` function is private. **The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as modules**.

Let’s also make the `add_to_waitlist` function public by adding the `pub` keyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-7: Adding the `pub` keyword to `mod hosting` and `fn add_to_waitlist` lets us call the function from `eat_at_restaurant`

Now the code will compile! Let’s look at the absolute and the relative path and double-check why adding the `pub` keyword lets us use these paths in `add_to_waitlist` with respect to the privacy rules.

In the absolute path, we start with `crate`, the root of our crate’s module tree. Then the `front_of_house` module is defined in the crate root. **The `front_of_house` module isn’t public, but because the `eat_at_restaurant` function is defined in the same module as `front_of_house` (that is, `eat_at_restaurant` and `front_of_house` are siblings), we can refer to `front_of_house` from `eat_at_restaurant`.** Next is the `hosting` module marked with `pub`. We can access the parent module of `hosting`, so we can access `hosting`. Finally, the `add_to_waitlist` function is marked with `pub` and we can access its parent module, so this function call works!

In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the first step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from `front_of_house`. The `front_of_house` module is defined within the same module as `eat_at_restaurant`, so the relative path starting from the module in which `eat_at_restaurant` is defined works. Then, because `hosting` and `add_to_waitlist` are marked with `pub`, the rest of the path works, and this function call is valid!

### Starting Relative Paths with `super`

We can also construct relative paths that begin in the parent module by using `super` at the start of the path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the `..` syntax. Why would we want to do this?

Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The function `fix_incorrect_order` calls the function `serve_order` by specifying the path to `serve_order` starting with `super`:

```rust
fn serve_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::serve_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
```

Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path starting with `super`

The `fix_incorrect_order` function is in the `back_of_house` module, so we can use `super` to go to the parent module of `back_of_house`, which in this case is `crate`, the root. From there, we look for `serve_order` and find it. Success! We think the `back_of_house` module and the `serve_order` function are likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved together should we decide to reorganize the crate’s module tree. Therefore, we used `super` so we’ll have fewer places to update code in the future if this code gets moved to a different module.

### Making Structs and Enums Public

+ **struct声明pub时，内部的所有fields默认还是private，需要单独声明pub；**

+ **enum声明pub时，内部所有enum variants默认pub**

We can also use `pub` to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a few extra details. **If we use `pub` before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct’s fields will still be private**. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis. In Listing 7-9, we’ve defined a public `back_of_house::Breakfast` struct with a public `toast` field but a private `seasonal_fruit` field. This models the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that comes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based on what’s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so customers can’t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
    println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
}
```

Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some private fields

Because the `toast` field in the `back_of_house::Breakfast` struct is public, in `eat_at_restaurant` we can write and read to the `toast` field using dot notation. Notice that we can’t use the `seasonal_fruit` field in `eat_at_restaurant` because `seasonal_fruit` is private. Try uncommenting the line modifying the `seasonal_fruit` field value to see what error you get!

Also, note that because `back_of_house::Breakfast` has a private field, the struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an instance of `Breakfast` (we’ve named it `summer` here). If `Breakfast` didn’t have such a function, we couldn’t create an instance of `Breakfast` in `eat_at_restaurant` because we couldn’t set the value of the private `seasonal_fruit` field in `eat_at_restaurant`.

**In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public**. We only need the `pub` before the `enum` keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
```

Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its variants public

Because we made the `Appetizer` enum public, we can use the `Soup` and `Salad` variants in `eat_at_restaurant`. Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; **it would be annoying to have to annotate all enum variants with `pub` in every case, so the default for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`**.

There’s one more situation involving `pub` that we haven’t covered, and that is our last module system feature: the `use` keyword. We’ll cover `use` by itself first, and then we’ll show how to combine `pub` and `use`.

## 7.4 Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword

It might seem like the paths we’ve written to call functions so far are inconveniently long and repetitive. For example, in Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to the `add_to_waitlist` function, every time we wanted to call `add_to_waitlist` we had to specify `front_of_house` and `hosting` too. **Fortunately, there’s a way to simplify this process. We can bring a path into a scope once and then call the items in that path as if they’re local items with the `use` keyword**.

In Listing 7-11, we bring the `crate::front_of_house::hosting` module into the scope of the `eat_at_restaurant` function so we only have to specify `hosting::add_to_waitlist` to call the `add_to_waitlist` function in `eat_at_restaurant`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-11: Bringing a module into scope with `use`

**Adding `use` and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in the filesystem**. By adding `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` in the crate root, `hosting` is now a valid name in that scope, just as though the `hosting` module had been defined in the crate root. Paths brought into scope with `use` also check privacy, like any other paths.

**You can also bring an item into scope with `use` and a relative path**. Listing 7-12 shows how to specify a relative path to get the same behavior as in Listing 7-11.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use self::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-12: Bringing a module into scope with `use` and a relative path

### Creating Idiomatic `use` Paths

In Listing 7-11, you might have wondered why we specified `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` and then called `hosting::add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant` rather than specifying the `use` path all the way out to the `add_to_waitlist` function to achieve the same result, as in Listing 7-13.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
    add_to_waitlist();
    add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-13: Bringing the `add_to_waitlist` function into scope with `use`, which is unidiomatic

Although both Listing 7-11 and 7-13 accomplish the same task, Listing 7-11 is the idiomatic way to bring a function into scope with `use`. **Bringing the function’s parent module into scope with `use` means we have to specify the parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path**. <u>The code in Listing 7-13 is unclear as to where `add_to_waitlist` is defined.</u>

**On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with `use`, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path**. Listing 7-14 shows the idiomatic way to bring the standard library’s `HashMap` struct into the scope of a binary crate.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
```

Listing 7-14: Bringing `HashMap` into scope in an idiomatic way

There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.

**The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name into scope with `use` statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that**. Listing 7-15 shows how to bring two `Result` types into scope that have the same name but different parent modules and how to refer to them.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

Listing 7-15: Bringing two types with the same name into the same scope requires using their parent modules.

As you can see, **using the parent modules distinguishes the two `Result` types**. If instead we specified `use std::fmt::Result` and `use std::io::Result`, we’d have two `Result` types in the same scope and Rust wouldn’t know which one we meant when we used `Result`.

### Providing New Names with the `as` Keyword

**There’s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name into the same scope with `use`: after the path, we can specify `as` and a new local name, or alias, for the type**. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write the code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two `Result` types using `as`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

Listing 7-16: Renaming a type when it’s brought into scope with the `as` keyword

In the second `use` statement, we chose the new name `IoResult` for the `std::io::Result` type, which won’t conflict with the `Result` from `std::fmt` that we’ve also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!

### Re-exporting Names with `pub use`

**When we bring a name into scope with the `use` keyword, the name available in the new scope is private**. To enable the code that calls our code to refer to that name as if it had been defined in that code’s scope, we can combine `pub` and `use`. **This technique is called *re-exporting* because we’re bringing an item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into their scope**.

Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with `use` in the root module changed to `pub use`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-17: Making a name available for any code to use from a new scope with `pub use`

By using `pub use`, external code can now call the `add_to_waitlist` function using `hosting::add_to_waitlist`. If we hadn’t specified `pub use`, the `eat_at_restaurant` function could call `hosting::add_to_waitlist` in its scope, but external code couldn’t take advantage of this new path.

Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a restaurant probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With `pub use`, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different structure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library.

### Using External Packages

In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external package called `rand` to get random numbers. To use `rand` in our project, we added this line to *Cargo.toml*:

Filename: Cargo.toml

```toml
rand = "0.8.3"
```

Adding `rand` as a dependency in *Cargo.toml* tells Cargo to download the `rand` package and any dependencies from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and make `rand` available to our project.

Then, to bring `rand` definitions into the scope of our package, we added a `use` line starting with the name of the crate, `rand`, and listed the items we wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in the [“Generating a Random Number”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number) section in Chapter 2, we brought the `Rng` trait into scope and called the `rand::thread_rng` function:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
}
```

**Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at [crates.io](https://crates.io/), and pulling any of them into your package involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s *Cargo.toml* file and using `use` to bring items from their crates into scope.**

**Note that the standard library (`std`) is also a crate that’s external to our package**. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we don’t need to change *Cargo.toml* to include `std`. But we do need to refer to it with `use` to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example, with `HashMap` we would use this line:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
```

**This is an absolute path starting with `std`, the name of the standard library crate**.

### Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large `use` Lists

If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module, listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our files. For example, these two `use` statements we had in the Guessing Game in Listing 2-4 bring items from `std` into scope:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
// --snip--
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// --snip--
```

Instead, **we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one line**. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
// --snip--
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
// --snip--
```

Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple items with the same prefix into scope

In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate `use` statements needed by a lot!

**We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining two `use` statements that share a subpath**. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two `use` statements: one that brings `std::io` into scope and one that brings `std::io::Write` into scope.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::Write;
```

Listing 7-19: Two `use` statements where one is a subpath of the other

The common part of these two paths is `std::io`, and that’s the complete first path. **To merge these two paths into one `use` statement, we can use `self` in the nested path**, as shown in Listing 7-20.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
```

Listing 7-20: Combining the paths in Listing 7-19 into one `use` statement

This line brings `std::io` and `std::io::Write` into scope.

### The Glob Operator

**If we want to bring *all* public items defined in a path into scope, we can specify that path followed by `*`**, the glob operator:

```rust
use std::collections::*;
```

This `use` statement brings all public items defined in `std::collections` into the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program was defined.

**The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test into the `tests` module**; we’ll talk about that in the [“How to Write Tests”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html#how-to-write-tests) section in Chapter 11. The glob operator is also sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: see [the standard library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html#other-preludes) for more information on that pattern.

## 7.5 Separating Modules into Different Files

> [Rust:mod、crate、super、self、pub use等模块系统用法梳理_Julia & Rust & Python-CSDN博客_rust super](https://blog.csdn.net/wowotuo/article/details/107591501)

So far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one file. When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate file to make the code easier to navigate.

For example, let’s start from the code in Listing 7-17 and move the `front_of_house` module to its own file *src/front_of_house.rs* by changing the crate root file so it contains the code shown in Listing 7-21. **In this case, the crate root file is *src/lib.rs*, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate root file is *src/main.rs***.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Listing 7-21: Declaring the `front_of_house` module whose body will be in *src/front_of_house.rs*

And *src/front_of_house.rs* gets the definitions from the body of the `front_of_house` module, as shown in Listing 7-22.

Filename: src/front_of_house.rs

```rust
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

Listing 7-22: Definitions inside the `front_of_house` module in *src/front_of_house.rs*

**Using a semicolon after `mod front_of_house` rather than using a block tells Rust to load the contents of the module from another file with the same name as the module**. To continue with our example and extract the `hosting` module to its own file as well, we change *src/front_of_house.rs* to contain only the declaration of the `hosting` module:

Filename: src/front_of_house.rs

```rust
pub mod hosting;
```

Then we create a *src/front_of_house* directory and a file *src/front_of_house/hosting.rs* to contain the definitions made in the `hosting` module:

Filename: src/front_of_house/hosting.rs

```rust
pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
```

The module tree remains the same, and the function calls in `eat_at_restaurant` will work without any modification, even though the definitions live in different files. This technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.

Note that the `pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting` statement in *src/lib.rs* also hasn’t changed, nor does `use` have any impact on what files are compiled as part of the crate. **The `mod` keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module**.

### Summary

Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules so you can refer to items defined in one module from another module. You can do this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be brought into scope with a `use` statement so you can use a shorter path for multiple uses of the item in that scope. Module code is private by default, but you can make definitions public by adding the `pub` keyword.

In the next chapter, we’ll look at some collection data structures in the standard library that you can use in your neatly organized code.

# 8. Common Collections

Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called *collections*. Most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values. **Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap**, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a skill you’ll develop over time. In this chapter, we’ll discuss three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:

- A *vector* allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- A *string* is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the `String` type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
- A *hash map* allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a *map*.

To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library, see [the documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html).

We’ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well as what makes each special.

## 8.1 Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

The first collection type we’ll look at is `Vec<T>`, also known as a *vector*. Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. **Vectors can only store values of the same type**. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.

### Creating a New Vector

To create a new, empty vector, we can call the `Vec::new` function, as shown in Listing 8-1.

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

Listing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values of type `i32`

<u>Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend to store</u>. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics; we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now, know that the `Vec<T>` type provided by the standard library can hold any type, and when a specific vector holds a specific type, the type is specified within angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that the `Vec<T>` in `v` will hold elements of the `i32` type.

**In more realistic code, Rust can often infer the type of value you want to store once you insert values, so you rarely need to do this type annotation. It’s more common to create a `Vec<T>` that has initial values, and Rust provides the `vec!` macro for convenience**. The macro will create a new vector that holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new `Vec<i32>` that holds the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The integer type is `i32` because that’s the default integer type, as we discussed in the [“Data Types”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types) section of Chapter 3.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

Listing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing values

Because we’ve given initial `i32` values, Rust can infer that the type of `v` is `Vec<i32>`, and the type annotation isn’t necessary. Next, we’ll look at how to modify a vector.

### Updating a Vector

To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the `push` method, as shown in Listing 8-3.

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```

Listing 8-3: Using the `push` method to add values to a vector

As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to make it mutable using the `mut` keyword, as discussed in Chapter 3. **The numbers we place inside are all of type `i32`, and Rust infers this from the data, so we don’t need the `Vec<i32>` annotation**.

### Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements

**Like any other `struct`, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope**, as annotated in Listing 8-4.

```rust
{
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

  // do stuff with v
} // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
```

Listing 8-4: Showing where the vector and its elements are dropped

**When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning those integers it holds will be cleaned up**. This may seem like a straightforward point but can get a bit more complicated when you start to introduce references to the elements of the vector. Let’s tackle that next!

### Reading Elements of Vectors

Now that you know how to create, update, and destroy vectors, knowing how to read their contents is a good next step. There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector. In the examples, we’ve annotated the types of the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.

Listing 8-5 shows both methods of **accessing a value in a vector, either with indexing syntax or the `get` method.**

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println!("The third element is {}", third);

match v.get(2) {
  Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
  None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```

Listing 8-5: Using indexing syntax or the `get` method to access an item in a vector

Note two details here. First, we use the index value of `2` to get the third element: vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. **Second, the two ways to get the third element are by using `&` and `[]`, which gives us a reference, or by using the `get` method with the index passed as an argument, which gives us an `Option<&T>`**.

Rust has two ways to reference an element so you can choose how the program behaves when you try to use an index value that the vector doesn’t have an element for. As an example, let’s see what a program will do if it has a vector that holds five elements and then tries to access an element at index 100, as shown in Listing 8-6.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let does_not_exist = &v[100];
let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
```

Listing 8-6: Attempting to access the element at index 100 in a vector containing five elements

**When we run this code, the first `[]` method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent element**. This method is best used when you want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element past the end of the vector.

**When the `get` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns `None` without panicking**. You would use this method if accessing an element beyond the range of the vector happens occasionally under normal circumstances. <u>Your code will then have logic to handle having either `Some(&element)` or `None`, as discussed in Chapter 6</u>. For example, the index could be coming from a person entering a number. <u>If they accidentally enter a number that’s too large and the program gets a `None` value, you could tell the user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to enter a valid value</u>. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program due to a typo!

When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. **<u>Recall the rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same scope</u>**. That rule applies in Listing 8-7, where we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end, which won’t work if we also try to refer to that element later in the function:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0];

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {}", first);
```

Listing 8-7: Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item

Compiling this code will result in this error:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let first = &v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 | 
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | 
8 |     println!("The first element is: {}", first);
  |                                          ----- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `collections` due to previous error
```

The code in Listing 8-7 might look like it should work: why should a reference to the first element care about what changes at the end of the vector? **This error is due to the way vectors work: adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector currently is. <u>In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation</u>**.

> Note: For more on the implementation details of the `Vec<T>` type, see [“The Rustonomicon”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec/vec.html).

### Iterating over the Values in a Vector

If we want to access each element in a vector in turn, we can iterate through all of the elements rather than use indices to access one at a time. Listing 8-8 shows how to **use a `for` loop to get immutable references to each element in a vector** of `i32` values and print them.

```rust
    let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &v {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
```

Listing 8-8: Printing each element in a vector by iterating over the elements using a `for` loop

We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector in order to make changes to all the elements. The `for` loop in Listing 8-9 will add `50` to each element.

```rust
    let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
    for i in &mut v {
        *i += 50;
    }
```

Listing 8-9: Iterating over mutable references to elements in a vector

**To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the dereference operator (`*`) to get to the value in `i` before we can use the `+=` operator.** We’ll talk more about the dereference operator in the [“Following the Pointer to the Value with the Dereference Operator”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html#following-the-pointer-to-the-value-with-the-dereference-operator) section of Chapter 15.

### Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

At the beginning of this chapter, we said that vectors can only store values that are the same type. This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of different types. **<u>Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, so when we need to store elements of a different type in a vector, we can define and use an enum</u>**!

For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which some of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers, and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different value types, and then **all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that of the enum.** Then we can create a vector that holds that enum and so, ultimately, holds different types. We’ve demonstrated this in Listing 8-10.

```rust
    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];
```

Listing 8-10: Defining an `enum` to store values of different types in one vector

**Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element**. A secondary advantage is that we can be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector. If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or more of the types would cause errors with the operations performed on the elements of the vector. Using an enum plus a `match` expression means that Rust will ensure at compile time that every possible case is handled, as discussed in Chapter 6.

When you’re writing a program, if you don’t know the exhaustive set of types the program will get at runtime to store in a vector, the enum technique won’t work. Instead, you can use a trait object, which we’ll cover in Chapter 17.

Now that we’ve discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be sure to review [the API documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) for all the many useful methods defined on `Vec<T>` by the standard library. For example, in addition to `push`, a `pop` method removes and returns the last element. Let’s move on to the next collection type: `String`!

## 8.2 Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we’ll look at them in more depth now. New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a combination of three reasons: Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and **UTF-8**. These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you’re coming from other programming languages.

**It’s useful to discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text**. In this section, we’ll talk about the operations on `String` that every collection type has, such as creating, updating, and reading. We’ll also discuss the ways in which `String` is different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a `String` is complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret `String` data.

### What Is a String?

We’ll first define what we mean by the term *string*. **Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the string slice `str` that is usually seen in its borrowed form `&str`**. In Chapter 4, we talked about *string slices*, which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String literals, for example, are stored in the program’s binary and are therefore string slices.

**The `String` type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type**. When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they usually mean the `String` and the string slice `&str` types, not just one of those types. Although this section is largely about `String`, both types are used heavily in Rust’s standard library, and both `String` and string slices are UTF-8 encoded.

Rust’s standard library also includes a number of other string types, such as `OsString`, `OsStr`, `CString`, and `CStr`. Library crates can provide even more options for storing string data. See how those names all end in `String` or `Str`? They refer to owned and borrowed variants, just like the `String` and `str` types you’ve seen previously. These string types can store text in different encodings or be represented in memory in a different way, for example. We won’t discuss these other string types in this chapter; see their API documentation for more about how to use them and when each is appropriate.

### Creating a New String

Many of the same operations available with `Vec<T>` are available with `String` as well, starting with the `new` function to create a string, shown in Listing 8-11.

```rust
let mut s = String::new();
```

Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty `String`

This line creates a new empty string called `s`, which we can then load data into. **Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string with. For that, we use the `to_string` method, which is available on any type that implements the `Display` trait, as string literals do**. Listing 8-12 shows two examples.

```rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```

Listing 8-12: Using the `to_string` method to create a `String` from a string literal

This code creates a string containing `initial contents`.

We can also use the function `String::from` to create a `String` from a string literal. The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code from Listing 8-12 that uses `to_string`.

```rust
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

Listing 8-13: Using the `String::from` function to create a `String` from a string literal

Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them can seem redundant, but they all have their place! <u>In this case, `String::from` and `to_string` do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style</u>.

Remember that **strings are UTF-8 encoded**, so we can include any properly encoded data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.

```rust
let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
let hello = String::from("Hello");
let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
let hello = String::from("你好");
let hello = String::from("Olá");
let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

Listing 8-14: Storing greetings in different languages in strings

All of these are valid `String` values.

### Updating a String

A `String` can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents of a `Vec<T>`, if you push more data into it. In addition, you can conveniently use the `+` operator or the `format!` macro to concatenate `String` values.

#### Appending to a String with `push_str` and `push`

**We can grow a `String` by using the `push_str` method to append a string slice**, as shown in Listing 8-15.

```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```

Listing 8-15: Appending a string slice to a `String` using the `push_str` method

After these two lines, `s` will contain `foobar`. <u>The `push_str` method takes a string slice because we don’t necessarily want to take ownership of the parameter</u>. For example, the code in Listing 8-16 shows that it would be unfortunate if we weren’t able to use `s2` after appending its contents to `s1`.

```rust
let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
let s2 = "bar";
s1.push_str(s2);
println!("s2 is {}", s2);
```

Listing 8-16: Using a string slice after appending its contents to a `String`

If the `push_str` method took ownership of `s2`, we wouldn’t be able to print its value on the last line. However, this code works as we’d expect!

**The `push` method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the `String`**. Listing 8-17 shows code that adds the letter “l” to a `String` using the `push` method.

```rust
let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l');
```

Listing 8-17: Adding one character to a `String` value using `push`

As a result of this code, `s` will contain `lol`.

#### Concatenation with the `+` Operator or the `format!` Macro

Often, you’ll want to combine two existing strings. One way is to use the `+` operator, as shown in Listing 8-18.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```

Listing 8-18: Using the `+` operator to combine two `String` values into a new `String` value

The string `s3` will contain `Hello, world!` as a result of this code. The reason `s1` is no longer valid after the addition and the reason we used a reference to `s2` has to do with the signature of the method that gets called when we use the `+` operator. **The `+` operator uses the `add` method**, whose signature looks something like this:

```rust
fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
```

This isn’t the exact signature that’s in the standard library: in the standard library, `add` is defined using generics. Here, we’re looking at the signature of `add` with concrete types substituted for the generic ones, which is what happens when we call this method with `String` values. We’ll discuss generics in Chapter 10. This signature gives us the clues we need to understand the tricky bits of the `+` operator.

First, `s2` has an `&`, meaning that we’re adding a *reference* of the second string to the first string because of the `s` parameter in the `add` function: we can only add a `&str` to a `String`; we can’t add two `String` values together. But wait—the type of `&s2` is `&String`, not `&str`, as specified in the second parameter to `add`. So why does Listing 8-18 compile?

**The reason we’re able to use `&s2` in the call to `add` is that the compiler can *coerce* the `&String` argument into a `&str`**. When we call the `add` method, <u>Rust uses a *deref coercion*, which here turns `&s2` into `&s2[..]`</u>. We’ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because `add` does not take ownership of the `s` parameter, `s2` will still be a valid `String` after this operation.

Second, we can see in the signature that `add` takes ownership of `self`, <u>because `self` does *not* have an `&`. This means `s1` in Listing 8-18 will be moved into the `add` call and no longer be valid after that</u>. So although `let s3 = s1 + &s2;` looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this statement actually takes ownership of `s1`, appends a copy of the contents of `s2`, and then returns ownership of the result. **In other words, it looks like it’s making a lot of copies but isn’t; the implementation is more efficient than copying**.

If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the `+` operator gets unwieldy:

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("tic");
    let s2 = String::from("tac");
    let s3 = String::from("toe");

    let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;
```

At this point, `s` will be `tic-tac-toe`. With all of the `+` and `"` characters, it’s difficult to see what’s going on. For more complicated string combining, we can **use the `format!` macro**:

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("tic");
    let s2 = String::from("tac");
    let s3 = String::from("toe");

    let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);
```

This code also sets `s` to `tic-tac-toe`. The `format!` macro works in the same way as `println!`, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a `String` with the contents. The version of the code using `format!` is much easier to read, and **the code generated by the `format!` macro uses references so that this call doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters**.

### Indexing into Strings

In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a string by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation. However, if you try to access parts of a `String` using indexing syntax in Rust, you’ll get an error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];
```

Listing 8-19: Attempting to use indexing syntax with a String

This code will result in the following error:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
error[E0277]: the type `String` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`
 --> src/main.rs:3:13
  |
3 |     let h = s1[0];
  |             ^^^^^ `String` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`
  |
  = help: the trait `Index<{integer}>` is not implemented for `String`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
error: could not compile `collections` due to previous error
```

The error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don’t support indexing. But why not? To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in memory.

#### Internal Representation

**A `String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`**. Let’s look at some of our properly encoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:

```rust
let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

**In this case, `len` will be 4, which means the vector storing the string “Hola” is 4 bytes long**. Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in **UTF-8**. But what about the following line? (Note that this string begins with the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the Arabic number 3.)

```rust
let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
```

Asked how long the string is, you might say 12. However, Rust’s answer is 24: that’s the number of bytes it takes to encode “Здравствуйте” in **UTF-8**, because each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage. Therefore, an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code:

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let answer = &hello[0];
```

What should the value of `answer` be? Should it be `З`, the first letter? When encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of `З` is `208` and the second is `151`, so `answer` should in fact be `208`, but `208` is not a valid character on its own. Returning `208` is likely not what a user would want if they asked for the first letter of this string; however, that’s the only data that Rust has at byte index 0. Users generally don’t want the byte value returned, even if the string contains only Latin letters: if `&"hello"[0]` were valid code that returned the byte value, it would return `104`, not `h`. To avoid returning an unexpected value and causing bugs that might not be discovered immediately, **Rust doesn’t compile this code at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process**.

#### Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!

**Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to look at strings from Rust’s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters (the closest thing to what we would call *letters*)**.

If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it is stored as a vector of `u8` values that looks like this:

```text
[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
```

That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at them as Unicode scalar values, which are what <u>Rust’s `char` type</u> is, those bytes look like this:

```text
['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
```

There are six `char` values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters: they’re diacritics that don’t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at them as <u>grapheme clusters</u>, we’d get what a person would call the four letters that make up the Hindi word:

```text
["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]
```

Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers store so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter what human language the data is in.

**A final reason Rust doesn’t allow us to index into a `String` to get a character is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time (O(1)). But it isn’t possible to guarantee that performance with a `String`, because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the index to determine how many valid characters there were.**

### Slicing Strings

**Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it’s not clear what the return type of the string-indexing operation should be: a byte value, a character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice**. Therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific if you really need to use indices to create string slices. To be more specific in your indexing and indicate that you want a string slice, rather than indexing using `[]` with a single number, **you can use `[]` with a range to create a string slice containing particular bytes**:

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";

let s = &hello[0..4];
```

Here, `s` will be a `&str` that contains the first 4 bytes of the string. <u>Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was 2 bytes, which means `s` will be `Зд`.</u>

**What would happen if we used `&hello[0..1]`? The answer: Rust would panic at runtime in the same way as if an invalid index were accessed in a vector**:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
     Running `target/debug/collections`
thread 'main' panicked at 'byte index 1 is not a char boundary; it is inside 'З' (bytes 0..2) of `Здравствуйте`', src/main.rs:4:14
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

You should use ranges to create string slices with caution, because doing so can crash your program.

### Methods for Iterating Over Strings

Fortunately, you can access elements in a string in other ways.

**If you need to perform operations on individual Unicode scalar values, the best way to do so is to use the `chars` method**. Calling `chars` on “नमस्ते” separates out and returns six values of type `char`, and you can iterate over the result to access each element:

```rust
for c in "नमस्ते".chars() {
    println!("{}", c);
}
```

This code will print the following:

```text
न
म
स
्
त
े
```

The `bytes` method returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your domain:

```rust
for b in "नमस्ते".bytes() {
    println!("{}", b);
}
```

This code will print the 18 bytes that make up this `String`:

```text
224
164
// --snip--
165
135
```

But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more than 1 byte.

**Getting grapheme clusters from strings is complex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard library. Crates are available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) if this is the functionality you need**.

### Strings Are Not So Simple

To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. **Rust has chosen to make the correct handling of `String` data the default behavior for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into handling UTF-8 data upfront**. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of strings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your development life cycle.

Let’s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!

## 8.3 Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

The last of our common collections is the *hash map*. The type `HashMap<K, V>` stores a mapping of keys of type `K` to values of type `V`. It does this via a *hashing function*, which determines how it places these keys and values into memory. Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but they often use a different name, such as hash, map, object, hash table, dictionary, or associative array, just to name a few.

> We’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies are hiding in the functions defined on `HashMap<K, V>` by the standard library. As always, check the standard library documentation for more information.

### Creating a New Hash Map

You can create an empty hash map with `new` and add elements with `insert`. In Listing 8-20, we’re keeping track of the scores of two teams whose names are Blue and Yellow. The Blue team starts with 10 points, and the Yellow team starts with 50.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
```

Listing 8-20: Creating a new hash map and inserting some keys and values

**Note that we need to first `use` the `HashMap` from the collections portion of the standard library.** Of our three common collections, this one is the least often used, so it’s not included in the features brought into scope automatically in the prelude. **Hash maps also have less support from the standard library; there’s no built-in macro to construct them, for example**.

**Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap**. This `HashMap` has keys of type `String` and values of type `i32`. **Like vectors, hash maps are homogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values must have the same type**.

Another way of constructing a hash map is by using iterators and the `collect` method on a vector of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key and its value. We’ll be going into more detail about iterators and their associated methods in the [”Processing a Series of Items with Iterators” section of Chapter 13](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html). The `collect` method gathers data into a number of collection types, including `HashMap`. For example, if we had the team names and initial scores in two separate vectors, we could use the `zip` method to create an iterator of tuples where “Blue” is paired with 10, and so forth. Then we could use the `collect` method to turn that iterator of tuples into a hash map, as shown in Listing 8-21.

```rust
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let teams = vec![String::from("Blue"), String::from("Yellow")];
    let initial_scores = vec![10, 50];

    let mut scores: HashMap<_, _> =
        teams.into_iter().zip(initial_scores.into_iter()).collect();
```

Listing 8-21: Creating a hash map from a list of teams and a list of scores

**The type annotation `HashMap<_, _>` is needed here because it’s possible to `collect` into many different data structures and Rust doesn’t know which you want unless you specify**. For the parameters for the key and value types, however, we use underscores, and Rust can infer the types that the hash map contains based on the types of the data in the vectors. In Listing 8-21, the key type will be `String` and the value type will be `i32`, just as the types were in Listing 8-20.

### Hash Maps and Ownership

**For types that implement the `Copy` trait, like `i32`, the values are copied into the hash map. For owned values like `String`, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values**, as demonstrated in Listing 8-22.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
// see what compiler error you get!
```

Listing 8-22: Showing that keys and values are owned by the hash map once they’re inserted

We aren’t able to use the variables `field_name` and `field_value` after they’ve been moved into the hash map with the call to `insert`.

<u>If we insert references to values into the hash map, the values won’t be moved into the hash map</u>. **The values that the references point to must be valid for at least as long as the hash map is valid.** We’ll talk more about these issues in the [“Validating References with Lifetimes”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#validating-references-with-lifetimes) section in Chapter 10.

### Accessing Values in a Hash Map

We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the `get` method, as shown in Listing 8-23.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name);
```

Listing 8-23: Accessing the score for the Blue team stored in the hash map

Here, `score` will have the value that’s associated with the Blue team, and the result will be `Some(&10)`. **The result is wrapped in `Some` because `get` returns an `Option<&V>`; if there’s no value for that key in the hash map, `get` will return `None`**. The program will need to handle the `Option` in one of the ways that we covered in Chapter 6.

We can iterate over each key/value pair in a hash map in a similar manner as we do with vectors, using a `for` loop:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

for (key, value) in &scores {
  println!("{}: {}", key, value);
}
```

This code will print each pair in an arbitrary order:

```text
Yellow: 50
Blue: 10
```

### Updating a Hash Map

Although the number of keys and values is growable, each key can only have one value associated with it at a time. When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could keep the old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the key *doesn’t* already have a value. Or you could combine the old value and the new value. Let’s look at how to do each of these!

#### Overwriting a Value

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced. Even though the code in Listing 8-24 calls `insert` twice, the hash map will only contain one key/value pair because we’re inserting the value for the Blue team’s key both times.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

Listing 8-24: Replacing a value stored with a particular key

This code will print `{"Blue": 25}`. The original value of `10` has been overwritten.

#### Only Inserting a Value If the Key Has No Value

It’s common to check whether a particular key has a value and, if it doesn’t, insert a value for it. Hash maps have a special API for this called `entry` that takes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return value of the `entry` method is an enum called `Entry` that represents a value that might or might not exist. Let’s say we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value associated with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value 50, and the same for the Blue team. Using the `entry` API, the code looks like Listing 8-25.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

Listing 8-25: Using the `entry` method to only insert if the key does not already have a value

**The `or_insert` method on `Entry` is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the corresponding `Entry` key if that key exists, and if not, inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable reference to the new value**. This technique is much cleaner than writing the logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.

Running the code in Listing 8-25 will print `{"Yellow": 50, "Blue": 10}`. The first call to `entry` will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value 50 because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to `entry` will not change the hash map because the Blue team already has the value 10.

#### Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then update it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-26 shows code that counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we’ve seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first insert the value 0.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
  let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
  *count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map);
```

Listing 8-26: Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words and counts

This code will print `{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}`. The `split_whitespace` method iterates over sub-slices, separated by whitespace, of the value in `text`. **The `or_insert` method returns a mutable reference (`&mut V`) to the value for the specified key**. Here we store that mutable reference in the `count` variable, so in order to assign to that value, we must first dereference `count` using the asterisk (`*`). The mutable reference goes out of scope at the end of the `for` loop, so all of these changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.

### Hashing Functions

**By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing function called SipHash that can provide resistance to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks involving hash tables** [1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html#siphash). This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in performance is worth it. If you profile your code and find that the default hash function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another function by specifying a different *hasher*. A hasher is a type that implements the `BuildHasher` trait. We’ll talk about traits and how to implement them in Chapter 10. You don’t necessarily have to implement your own hasher from scratch; **[crates.io](https://crates.io/) has libraries shared by other Rust users that provide hashers implementing many common hashing algorithms.**
